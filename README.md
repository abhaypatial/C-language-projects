C Language Projects

**Description**

This repository contains C programming projects and exercises that I am working on as part of my Bachelor of Science in Data Science and AI at IIT Guwahati. The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in C programming, which complements my work in data science and artificial intelligence by enhancing low-level computational skills and algorithmic thinking.

**Features**

Basic Programs: Hello World, conditionals, loops, etc.
Algorithms: 
Data Structures:
File Handling:
Advanced Concepts:

**Why C?**

Even though C is not directly used in AI and Data Science, understanding it provides:

Low-Level Programming Insight: It helps understand how things work under the hood.
Performance Optimization: Knowing C aids in writing efficient code when working with large datasets and algorithms.
Foundation for Other Languages: C is a base for many modern programming languages.

**How to Use**

Clone this repository:

Copy code
